# BikeHub Android App

## Overview  
BikeHub is an Android application designed to help users discover, browse, and purchase motorcycles. The app features categorized bike listings with expandable details, infinite scrolling for on-sale bikes, and intuitive navigation between browsing and buying modes.

## Features

- **Nested RecyclerViews**  
  Categories are displayed in a vertical list, each expandable to reveal a nested list of bikes belonging to that category.

  Categories and individual bike items can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide additional information such as detailed descriptions and images.

- **Infinite Scrolling (Pagination)**  
  The on-sale bikes list supports dynamic loading of data as the user scrolls, enabling smooth infinite scroll behavior.

- **Item Swiping**  
  Bikes in the on-sale list can be swiped left or right to perform delete actions.

  Bikes can be selected using checkboxes for single or multiple selections.

- **Multiple View Types**
